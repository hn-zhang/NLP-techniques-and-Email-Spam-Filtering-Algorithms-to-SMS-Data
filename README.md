Application of NLP techniques and Email Spam Filtering Algorithms to SMS Data

In this project, a variety of popular email spam filtering algorithms were implemented on the Short Message Service (SMS) dataset. Different methods of using a matrix to represent the data set in NLP were attempted. In addition to using only tokens, other features of the message, such as the proportion of numbers or capital letters, are explored. The final classification results are presented.
